                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>CADMore is a novel formulation developed to trigger overall development of the plant starting from seed germination to leaf development to root / shoot growth, flower appearance, fruit setting and appearance and enhanced shelf-life. CADMore triggers specific functions attributed to plant organ imparting higher internal strength to resist biotic and abiotic stress faced during crop duration. CADMore is non-toxic and can be applied with any other chemical at any growth stage of the crop.</p>

                        <li>It acts as a natural chelating agent, slowing oxidation and converting metallic elements into readily absorbable, bio-available nutrition with very small molecular size allowing fulvic-chelated minerals rapid entry through plant cells.</li>
