                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>CADMore is a novel formulation developed to trigger overall development of the plant starting from seed germination to leaf development to root / shoot growth, flower appearance, fruit setting and appearance and enhanced shelf-life. CADMore triggers specific functions attributed to plant organ imparting higher internal strength to resist biotic and abiotic stress faced during crop duration. CADMore is non-toxic and can be applied with any other chemical at any growth stage of the crop.</p>

                        <li>It offers better drought protection, as it holds and supplies water droplets near to a plants’ root, giving a more even supply of moisture to the plants.</li>
                        <li>It encourages stronger, healthier plants that have a greater resistance to diseases coupled with having phytotoxic properties against soil pathogens.</li>
                        <li>It assists osmosis in plants and helps them increase the uptake of nutrients and proteins that will give the plants a boost to overcome the distress.</li>
                        <li>It dissolves minerals and trace elements fast-tracking the plant availability of rock minerals, i.e., rock phosphate and lime.</li>
                        <li>It acts as a natural chelating agent, slowing oxidation and converting metallic elements into readily absorbable, bio-available nutrition with very small molecular size allowing fulvic-chelated minerals rapid entry through plant cells.</li>
                        <li>It dissolves silica and magnifies the many benefits of this element.</li>
