                <h2>What is Plant Tissue Culture ?</h2>

            </div>
            <p class="text-justify">Plant tissue culture is a technique by which single cell or tissue can be regenerated into a complete plant. This process is carried out in a suitable culture medium under controlled environmental conditions of temperature, light and humidity. The advantage of PTC is that a plant can be developed from any part of the mother plant. However, meristematic tissue such as shoot tip is considered to be ideal. There are various plants and crops that can be propagated through PTC, but they often require different culture mediums and also different environmental conditions.</p>
            <p class="text-justify">Tissue culture means micro-propagation of tissues of the selected Elite plants. The process consists of various steps such as Initiation, Multiplication, Shooting & Rooting. Initial acclimatization is done in Green-houses and then Secondary Hardening in shade houses where there is limited control of environmental conditions.</p>
