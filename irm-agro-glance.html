            <p class="text-justify">CADAgro has already set up an extensive Agro distribution channel in 14 states and plans to expand to other states in near future. The long-term vision is to participate in complete value chain of Agro Product. In domestic tissue-culture and bio-products business, our approach with the farmers group, co-operatives and societies have been very effective and efficient, in addition to the traditional distributors and retailer relationship. The high technology inputs supplied by CADAgro will certainly reduce the risk of failure and improve the yield level in uncertain climatic conditions. </p>
