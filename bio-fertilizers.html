                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>Josh is a Mycorrhizal (Glomus intraradices) root inoculants which contains Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhiza (VAM) fungi developed by using technology licensed from TERI & DBT, Govt. of India, New Delhi. VAM is world’s strongest Mycorrhiza (Myco – fungal + rrhiza – roots) that adheres to plants roots and then boosts development of white root leading to significant increase in rhizosphere. VAM fungi form a special symbiotic relationship with roots of plant that can enhance growth and survivability of colonized plants. </p>

                    <h4>Benefits of Josh Super</h4>
                    <ul class="list-icon">
                        <li><b>Enhanced Uptake of Nutrients and water:</b> The hyphae of Mycorrhiza penetrate deep into the soil and nearby surroundings leading to increase in plant root zone resulting in increased availability of major and micronutrients as well water for the host plant.</li>
                        <li><b>Increased Solubility of Soil Minerals:</b> Facilitates solubiliization of unavailable forms of phosphorus and other nutrients that can be taken up by the plant roots reducing dependence on chemical fertilizers. </li>
                        <li><b>Increased Plant Growth:</b> Stimulates production of plant growth hormones in the mycorrhized plants and hence promote general growth of the plants.</li>
                        <li><b>Uniform Plant Growth:</b> Fungal hyphae have a positive impact on the hydric status and soil aggregation, leading to more uniform plant growth.</li>
                        <li><b>Improved Soil texture and structure:</b> VAM fungi produce chemicals that prevent excess compaction of the soil particles, making them more porous facilitating easy root penetration in the soil and increased soil micro-flora. Further, better root biomass reduces soil erosion.</li>
                        <li><b> Enhanced Resistance to Root Diseases:</b> VAM fungi have been reported to be responsible for transient stimulation of host-plant disease resistance mechanisms. </li>
                        <li><b>Phosphorous Solubility:</b> Solubilize complex phosphate and other nutrients to make bio available to plant roots.</li>
                        <li><b>Resistance:</b> Against drought, salinity, heavy metal stresses and other abiotic stresses. </li>
                        <li><b>Improved Hardiness and decrease “Transient Transplant Shock” of Tissue Culture raised Plant:</b> Due to their ability to facilitate better root growth and uptake of nutrients, VAM fungi improve the survival frequency of transplanted stocks, and also dramatically improve the hardening of tissue-culture plants.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduced Stunting on Fumigated Soils:</b> Application of mycorrhizal fungi in the fumigated soil, one month after fumigation gives very good response of the fungi in the form of homogenous foliage production and reduces stunted growth.</li>

                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>Aspergillus niger was isolated from rhizosphere of muskmelon, which were found to be healthy inspite of other fruits becoming spoiled due to fungal infection. A.niger was then standardized and stabilized in laboratory at IARI (Indian Agricultural Research Institute) and the broth was examined for various activities viz., different types of enzymes, growth, etc. Kalisena [A.niger strain (AN-27)] has dual functionality as it can be used as bio fertilizer as well as bio fungicide in all crops viz., fruit orchards, floriculture, vegetables, cereals, horticulture crops, cash crops, etc.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h4>Mode of Action</h4>
                    <p><b>As Bio-fungicide:</b> It produces compounds, which are antifungal, and acts against major harmful soil borne pathogens belonging to genus Pythium, Macrophomina, Sclerotinia, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, etc and many other soil borne pathogenic fungi.</p>
                    <p><b>As Biofertilizer:</b> Phosphate is present in complex form in soil as tricalcium phosphate or dicalcium phosphate. A.niger produces acid which breaks the complex and thus Solubilizes phosphate. Thus, it acts as bio fertilizer. Further, it produces two growth-promoting compounds of Gamma-lactone and Butanolide group that enhance seed germination (%) and are also responsible for improving shoot growth and root elongation. It also produces enzymes that augment the self defense mechanism of the plants.</p>

                        <li> It produces antifungal compounds of the gamma lactone group, which is responsible for the antibiosis of pathogen hyphae.</li>
                        <li>AN-27 is a parasite, which devours the dead pathogen hyphae by entering into it and also inhibits pathogen resting structure formation.</li>
                        <li>It augments plant’s defense through enzymes peroxidises, polyphenol oxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase. </li>
                        <li>Produces two growth promoting compounds responsible for not only shoot & root growth but also for increased seed germination.</li>
                        <li>Solubilizes the mineralized phosphate by virtue of organic acid production.</li>
                        <li>Has an extraordinary shelf-life of 2 years and is extremely safe for beneficial soil micro-flora.</li>
                        <li>It is an ubiquitous fungus that is effective in all soil types, can withstand temperature range from 0 to 45 degree Celsius and tolerate pH from 3 to 10.</li>
                        <li>Completely safe and eco-friendly and hence does not cause any toxicity or side-effects even at double dose.</li>

                    <p>AmiCAD- A Protein Hydrolysate based formulation is available in conc. upto 25 % protein content (existing branded formulation contains 15 %). AmiCAD is produced by the digestion of proteins in a form as needed and absorbed by the plants. AmiCAD possesses hormonal properties to boost plant growth as well as overall metabolic and physiological functioning of plants by improving soil micro-environment leading to enhanced productivity. The active nature of Amino Acids in AmiCAD formulations helps nutrients to get chelated and absorbed in the plant system. Minerals chelated with Amino Acids has enhanced absorption to the extent of 300 times. Further, foliar nutrition in the form of Protein Hydrolysate provides readymade building blocks for Protein synthesis.</p>

                    <p>This is a specially formulated, mycorrhiza based water soluble powder, consisting naturally derived phyto-compounds and amino acids. Mycorrhizae (VAM) are obligate symbiont and require living host for survival VAM fungi penetrate into the plant cells and produce vesicles. The structure of the arbuscules increase the contact surface between the hyphal and the cell cytoplasm to facilitate the transfer of nutrients between plant and mycorrhizae. This product is designed to be applied through drip irrigation system, at all vegetative stages of the plant.</p>

                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>CAD-PROM is the upgraded and improved version of phosphate rich organic manure. It contains about 10.46% Phosphate which is available to plant during its lifecycle Chemical Phosphate fertilizers contain more phosphate DAP 46%, SSP 16%) than “PROM”. However, because Of Phosphate ion problem, only 20% to 25% phosphate is made available to crop. Unavailability of phosphate and subsequently less yield with poor quality of crop is the major problem of farmers. CAD-PROM is the best answer to problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>Apart from Organic Phosphate fertilizer, CAD-PROM is also a soil rejuvenator . Micro-organisms are life of the soil. Fertility of the soil depends upon the quantity of beneficial Micro-organisms in the soil. CAD-PROM contains organic matters and cultures which is the food and energy for logarithmic growth of the Micro-organisms. Regular use of CAD-PROM increases soil micro flora, balances pH, EC and nutrients status of the soil. Soil becomes more healthy & fertile. </p>

                        <li>Acts as an alternative to DAP. It also contains Nitrogen fixing culture, which reduces the
                            Nitrogen requirement of the crop.
