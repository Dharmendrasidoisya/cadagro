                    <h4>General Information</h4>
                    <p>AmiCAD- A Protein Hydrolysate based formulation is available in conc. upto 25 % protein content (existing branded formulation contains 15 %). AmiCAD is produced by the digestion of proteins in a form as needed and absorbed by the plants. AmiCAD possesses hormonal properties to boost plant growth as well as overall metabolic and physiological functioning of plants by improving soil micro-environment leading to enhanced productivity. The active nature of Amino Acids in AmiCAD formulations helps nutrients to get chelated and absorbed in the plant system. Minerals chelated with Amino Acids has enhanced absorption to the extent of 300 times. Further, foliar nutrition in the form of Protein, Hydrolysate provide readymade building blocks for Protein synthesis.</p>

                        <li>AmiCAD plays a very important role during seed germination by enriching endosperm which is the major source of seedling growth and development.</li>
                        <li>Improves functional use efficiency of NPK fertilizers which reduces requirement and dependence on chemical fertilizers.</li>
                        <li>Strengthens plant root system by providing extended arms to the roots, facilitating movement of roots to deeper and wider layers in the soil, leading to :

                    <hr>
                    <h4>Mode of Action</h4>
                    <p>Mentor is absorbed by plant surface very easily and quickly forms bond with all nutrients thereby facilitates the uptake of nutrients in their available forms like Nitrogen as Nitrate, Sulphur as Sulphate, etc. As a result of application of Mentor, the use efficiency of all major plant nutrients has been reported to increase upto 15-20 per cent.</p>

                    <h4>Benefits of Mentor </h4>
                    <ul class="list-icon">
                        <li>Mentor is present in ready to use form and can be absorbed by plant surface very easily and quickly.</li>
                        <li>Stimulates plant growth by increased photosynthesis acting as catalyst in chlorophyll production</li>
                        <li>Enhance the quality and durability of harvest by initiating production of compounds responsible for characteristics odour, flavour & colour of harvest in crops like onion, mustard, garlic, etc.</li>
                        <li>Improves nutritional quality of harvest viz. higher protein percent due to higher and active conversion of inorganic N into protein in legumes / pulses, higher S for enhanced oil percent in oilseeds and carbohydrate in cereals.</li>
                        <li>Promotes nodule formulation in legumes resulting in better nitrogen fixation and thus helps in improving soil fertility.</li>
                        <li>Mentor has an excellent preventive efficacy against fungal pathogen and has multi-site contact and systematic action so no resistance problem.</li>
                        <li>Mentor has a long persistence on crop surface and has low UV-photo degradation and low vapour pressure.</li>
                        <li>Completely safe to vegetables, fruits, etc and is completely bio-degradable.</li>
                    </ul>
